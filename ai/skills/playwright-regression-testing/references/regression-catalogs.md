# Regression Catalogs

## Tier Model

```
Tier 0 — Smoke       (< 2 min)   → Critical path, runs on every commit
Tier 1 — Sanity      (< 10 min)  → Core features, runs on every PR
Tier 2 — Selective   (< 30 min)  → Change-based + risk-based, runs on merge
Tier 3 — Full        (< 60 min)  → Complete regression, runs nightly/pre-release
```

## Regression Types

| Type            | When                                     | Scope                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Corrective**  | No app code changed (infra, config, env) | Full suite to verify nothing broke |
| **Progressive** | New features added                       | Existing tests + new feature tests |
| **Selective**   | Specific code changes                    | Changed modules + dependent tests  |
| **Complete**    | Major refactor, release candidate        | Run everything across all projects |
